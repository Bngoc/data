    Coming soon!


CuteNews 1.5.3 release notes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0 Requirements

    - PHP 4.1.0 version is desired. Please use the older versions at your own risk;
    - There is &ldquo;iconv&rdquo; library available, in case of using a charset different from UTF-8.

2.0 Safety improvements

A   In order to authenticate and verify the security algorithm used XXTEA session Cookies. The essence of the method
    implementation:

    1. In the session is added REMOTE_ADDR to block repeated requests;
    2. Serialize $_SESS array into serialized string;
    3. Serialized string is encrypted using a randomly selected XXTEA with &ldquo;salt&rdquo; for the site;
    4. Encrypting a string is passed to the Cookies named `session`.

    What it gives?

    Protection against CSRF and open view of identification user data. In order to properly encrypt data and send them
    fraudulent manner, you need a &ldquo;salt&rdquo; and the IP address of the sender. Salt is unique for each site and set consists
    of a 512-bit encryption. The probability of selection of the cipher salt is actually zero. Each time you update a
    random number issued to confirm the return to the user, which is stored in an encrypted session.

    You also cannot resend the same token to another IP-address, since the encrypted data is IP-address of the sender
    and any attempt to send the wrong line leads to unlogin.

    However, nothing can protect any data from the session, and &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to, if not using a secure https-connection.
    To install it you have to buy a registrar certificate for your domain. Read more here

B   CAPTCHA

    The main problem in the web space is still spam. For writing news comments and for account registration captcha has
    been added, which uses session encryption mechanism through the Cookies, so that hacking by robot is impossible,
    too. The information is stored securely.

C   A function cleaning almost every XSS written by an offender in the comments or posts has been created.

D   Enhanced protection from the folder view with .htaccess has been added.
